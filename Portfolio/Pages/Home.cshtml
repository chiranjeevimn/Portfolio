            <p>
                I'm a Smart working CEH student specialized in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
                Along with my degree, I completed Python, SQL, Java, Cybersecurity courses and various technologies.
                What I learnt has helped me develop a project called "Drowsiness Detection & Alerting System".
                It was during this project that I discovered that I am a team player.
                I am currently seeking roles where I can utilize my experience and skill.<br>
